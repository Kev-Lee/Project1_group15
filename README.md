1) Question 1 take an input x and takes the 2's complement of x by taking the invert of x and adding 1. Then z is taken as the invert of y or x, and this value is shifted 31 bits to the right. It then returns z & 1. This is dependent on what input is taken in. If x is anything other than 0, the code will return 0. If the input is 0, then the 2's complement of it to get 32 to bits of 0's because of the +1 overflow, and then we take the invert of 32 bits of 0's to get 32 bits of 1's. Shifting that 31 times to the right gives us 1 as the final value of z, and z & z is equal to 1.

2) Question 2 takes in an input x and then shifts the value 31 bits to the right. If the value is positive or 0, the mask value will be 32 bits of 0's, and if x is negative, the mask value will be 32 bits of 1's. y is x exclusive or the mask value, so when you have the mask as 32 bits of 0's y would equal x, and when you have 32 bits of 1's y would be the invert of x. Adding 1 to an invert mask equal to 32 bits of 1's would be 32 bits of 0's due to overflow, and adding 1 to the invert mask equal to 32 bits of 0's would give you 1. For the return value, when x is positive, you end up with x + 0 = x, and when x is negative, you end up with the ~x + 1 which is the 2's complement, which would be the absolute value of x. 

3) Question 3 takes in an input of x. y would equal the logical negation of x, which would mean that any number value that is not equal to 0 would become a 0 and a value equal to 0 would become 1. If x is positive or 0, z will be 32 bits of 0's and if x is negative, z will be 32 bits of 1's. Given the x value, if it is positive, you have the z value equaling 0 or 0 which is 0, if x is negative you have the z value equaling 1 or 0 which is 1, and if x is 0 you have the z value equaling 0 or 1 which is 1. The final line returns the logical negation of z, which would be 0 for negative numbers and 0, and 1 for positive numbers.
